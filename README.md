This component was designed using Leaflet Js. Leaflet us provides access to maps and the aim of the project is to demonstrate how seemless it is to integrate lightning with leaflet.

When a user clicks on a specific area on the map, the lat/ long is passed to the lightning controller and a contact is created against the Lat/Long by getting contact related inputs from the user.
